# ComputerNetworksF2020Project
My final project for Graduate Computer Networks Fall 2020

A comparison of various methodologies for a reinforcement learning framework to increase the service level of bikeshare networks.

To analyze the results that I have produced go to the results_analysis/analysis directory and experiment with the two analysis files. 


To produce your own results create the empty directories a b c and d in the experiments directory and run the test_suite scripts.


The codes a b c and d mark different environment settings:
 
 
 | Code | User Arrival Interest Distribution | User Destination Interest Distribution |
 |------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
 | a    | Uniform | Uniform |
 | b | Gaussian | Uniform |
 | c | Uniform | Gaussian |
 | d | Gaussian | Gaussian |
